dnl    This package has one dependency, l2h in thirdparty.

dnl    And requires that Perl is already built, from which we use the
dnl    starperl command.

dnl    which are present as .tex files in this directory.

dnl    We override the standard .tex.htx_tar rule inside Makefile.am, and so
dnl    don't need the @STAR2HTML@ substitution.

dnl    Note that the latex2html.in and star2html.in files contain
dnl    references to the installation directories, and so must be
dnl    substituted here at make time, rather than by ./configure at
dnl    configuration time.  See section `Installation Directory
dnl    Variables' in the autoconf manual for discussion.
