dnl    Include defaults for Starlink configurations

dnl    We have a C++ main function, but we call Fortran.  This defines
dnl    the cpp macro of the same name, which will do any 
dnl    initialisation which is necessary with this platform/compiler.
STAR_INITIALISE_FORTRAN

dnl    Sometimes also need to know the name of the Fortran MAIN.
AC_FC_MAIN

dnl    Need the generic compiler.

dnl    Look for a Tcl installation. Prefer the Starlink one as we require
dnl    itcl, tclx and BLT, but they are not supported by this command.

dnl    To configure the gaia component, which is modelled on the skycat
dnl    TEA-based Tcl system we would like to just run ./configure in the gaia
dnl    subdirectory, but it has some configure dependencies that may not
dnl    be available yet, so it's deferred until make time (see teagaia).
